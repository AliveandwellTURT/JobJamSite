Build a professional, single business website for JobJam — a New Zealand-based online coaching service that helps young people (ages 16–24, first-time jobseekers) gain the skills and confidence to land their first job. The website must be visually stunning, simple to navigate, mobile-friendly, and fully functional with backend forms and payment integration.
